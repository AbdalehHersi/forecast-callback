# forecast-callback

<p>This week I created a simple weather forcast dashboard with a focus on functionality</p>
<p>The page asks the user to input a city and then displays the current temprature, humidity, wind speed and uv index. It also displays a 5 day predicted weather forecast</p>

# challenges

<li>Finding and using the correct API's for each task</li>
<li>Storing onto local storage correctly without duplicate elements</li>
<li>Displaying the weather icons correctly</li>

# Successes

<li>Accesssing specific data in an API</li>
<li>Fetching reponse from API</li>
<li>Using parameters to convert units into metric</li>

# Application requirements

<li>WHEN the user searchs for a city
THEN they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history</li>
<li>WHEN the user views current weather conditions for that city
THEN they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index</li>
<li>WHEN the user views the UV index
THEN they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe</li>
<li>WHEN the user views future weather conditions for that city
THEN they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity</li>
<li>WHEN the user clicks on a city in the search history
THEN they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city</li>
